Graph -> 

1) non linearn ds 
2) collection of vertices and edges 

G(V,E) 
G(V) = {A,M,B,Bo,V}
G(E)={ (A,B),(A,M),(A,V), (M,Bo),(B,Bo),(B,V),(V,Bo) }



1) directed graph | diagraph -> edges has a direction 
2) undirected graph -> edges does not have any direction 
3) NullGraph -> graph does not have any edges 
4) connected graph -> each vertex is connected with atleast 1 vertex
 			graph doest not has isolated vertex 

5) complete graph -> each vertext is connected with every vertex
